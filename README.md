# Javascript Operators & Control Flow  
## Task 1  
Symbols:  

Arithmetic Operators - The arithmetic operators are used to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication (+ , -, *, /, %).

Assignment Operators - The assignment operators are used to assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=).

Comparison Operators - The comparison operators are used to compare two values in a Boolean fashion (==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, >=, <=).

Logical Operators - The logical operators are typically used to combine conditional statements (&&, ||, !).

Bitwise Operators - They are used to perform operation on bits (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>).

## Task 2
Examples:

Arithmetic Operators:

ex: let x = 20; y = 8;  
console.log(x + y);  
console.log(x - y);  

Assignment Operators:

ex: let x = 20;  
console.log(x);  
console.log(x += 10);  

Comparison Operators:

ex: let x = 20; y = 8;  
console.log(x != y);  
console.log(x === y);  

Logical Operators:

ex: let highIncome = true; goodCreditScore = false;  
console.log(highIncome || goodCreditScore);  
console.log(highIncome && goodCreditScore);  

Bitwise Operators:

ex: let x = 4; y = 2;  
console.log(4 & 2);  
console.log(4 | 2);  

## Task 4
for (let i=1; i< 20; i+=7){ console.log(i); }

Output: 1 8 15
